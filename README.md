MojaGlobal contribution.

Moja Global was founded in 2015 with the mission of supporting ambitious climate action by developing pioneering open-source software. The organization's goal is to provide reliable and accessible environmental data to decision-makers, policymakers, and communities to support effective climate action.

I'm interested in taking part in this project since Climate change is a pressing issue that affects every corner of the planet, including Kenya(My country). The rise in global temperatures is causing a wide range of negative impacts, including melting glaciers, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and extreme weather events such as droughts and floods.

In Kenya, climate change has a significant impact on the environment, economy, and social well-being of the population. For example, the country experiences frequent droughts and floods that damage crops and infrastructure, leading to food shortages and loss of livelihoods for many people.

To adapt to the effects of climate change, individuals, governments, and businesses must take action. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by switching to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable transportation. It also involves implementing sustainable land management practices such as reforestation and agroforestry, promoting water conservation, and improving infrastructure resilience to extreme weather events.

Moja Global's mission to support ambitious climate action through pioneering open-source software is essential in achieving these goals. Their software can help improve the accuracy of climate models, enhance climate monitoring systems, and support decision-making processes for policymakers, businesses, and individuals.

Ultimately, it is crucial that everyone takes responsibility for reducing their carbon footprint and taking action to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. By working together, we can create a more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.
